                        My name is Andy Marmolejos. I'm majoring in Computer Engineering and minoring in Web and App
                        Development.

                        My objectives for this course are to learn HTML/CSS. To be able to perform not just basics coding,
                        but complex coding that allows me to design a better looking website. Probably with animations,
                        better colors and design to get the attention of anyone. Currently we are working on
                        learning Bootstrap. Although, it makes it easier for anyone to build a website you still
                        have to understand much more than that to be able to show your uniqueness when it comes to
                        designing. SASS is similar to CSS, but better in some ways and that will allow us
                        to design those better website. Also, not forgetting about JavaScript which can do
                        most of the animations that we see in modern websites today.
